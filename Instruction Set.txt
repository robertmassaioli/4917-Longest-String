The 4917 Microprocessor

Instruction Set

	One Byte Instructions:
		0	Halt Program
		1	R0 = R0 + R1
		2	R0 = R0 - R1
		3	R0++
		4	R1++
		5	R0--
		6	R1--
		7	Ring Bell (Nothing really [Side Effect])

	Two Byte Instructions:
		8	x	Print x
		9	x	Load value at location x into R0
		10	x	Load value at location x into R1
		11	x	Store value in R0 into location x
		12	x	Store value in R1 into location x
		13	x	Goto x
		14	x	If R0 == 0 Then Goto x
		15	x	If R0 != 0 Then Goto x

This instruction set can print out numbers in any order. A quine can be made in this language
and other amazing things too. It is surprisingly powerful.
